# Netflix Data Analysis & Machine Learning Project 🎬📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end **Data Analytics and Machine Learning** workflow built using a Netflix dataset.  
The goal is to **clean data, perform exploratory analysis, build ML models, apply basic NLP techniques, and create interactive dashboards using Power BI**.

This project demonstrates practical skills required for **Data Analyst / Data Scientist / ML Engineer (Fresher – 1 Year Experience)** roles.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about Netflix content, including:
- Title
- Type (Movie / TV Show)
- Genre
- Country
- Release Year
- Duration
- Rating
- Description / Review Text

The dataset is first **cleaned and transformed** to make it suitable for analysis and visualization.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Performed using **Python (Pandas & NumPy)**:
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Converting mixed-type columns (e.g., duration)
- Feature extraction from text fields
- Encoding categorical variables

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to uncover insights such as:
- Content distribution by type and genre
- Country-wise content production
- Trends over years
- Rating analysis
- Duration patterns

Visualizations were created using:
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning
Basic ML models were implemented to demonstrate:
- Feature engineering
- Train-test split
- Model training and evaluation

Models used:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest (if applicable)

Metrics evaluated:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall

---

## 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Text-based features were analyzed using:
- Tokenization
- Vectorization (TF-IDF / CountVectorizer)
- Basic text insights from descriptions or reviews

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
An **interactive Power BI dashboard** was created to visualize:
- Total Movies vs TV Shows
- Genre distribution
- Country-wise content
- Year-wise growth
- Ratings analysis

This dashboard allows non-technical users to explore insights easily.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- NLP (basic)
- **Power BI**
- Jupyter Notebook

---
